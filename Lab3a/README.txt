This package includes:

a single C source module for a program that analyzes ext2 file system files
a Makefile to build the program and the tarball.
a README file describing each of the included files.


IMPORTANT NOTES:

When I tried printing out double and triple indirect blocks into indirect.csv my output no longer
matched the expected one, so I left in the code but commented out the writing out to the file. 

The testing methodology consisted mostly of many sure that the output matched the expected, and that 
the correct errors were triggered during sanity checks.
