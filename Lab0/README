This package contains:

A single C source module that compiles cleanly
A makefile to build test, and clean the program and build the tarball
A backtrace.png screenshot of a stack backtrace
A nullpointer.png screenshot of examination of nullpointer
A README describing the inluded files

TESTING PROTOCOL:
The quick smoke-test run by make check is a very simple test that checks
that the program can correctly open and write files, and that the segmentation
and catch returns the correct exit code. Since this is only a very basic 
smoketest, other tests are not included
